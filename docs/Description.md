# Description of the Study-Cards application

## General
The application has three frames: 
* Study Sets 
* Configuration 
* Flashcards

### The Study Sets frame
This is the first frame the user sees when the application starts. In this frame the user can select the study set to be used from a list of available study sets. The user can also add new study sets to that list.

A new study set is added by importing a text file where on each row there are two terms separated by a semicolon. The two terms will be shown on the two sides of a single card. Once a study set is selected the application displays the Configuration frame for that study set.

### The Configuration frame
In this frame the user can configure the way the study set will be presented. This includes filtering the cards is the study set to show either all the cards or just cards that have a particular tag. The tags are meant to allow the user to mark his or hers level of knowledge of the study card and to create groups of cards within the study set with similar level of knowledge. In this frame the user can also define the order in which the cards will be displayed, for example, in a random order. Finally, the user can define which side of the cards will be shown first is the next session. In addition, the user can see the total number of cards in the study set and the number of cards for each tag group. Note that the tags can differ depending on which side of the cards is shown first.
