# Description of the Study-Cards application

## General
The application has three frames: 
* Study Sets 
* Configuration 
* Flashcards

### The Study Sets frame
This is the first frame the user sees when the application starts. In this frame the user can select the study set to be used from a list of available study sets. The user can also add new study sets to that list.

A new study set is added by importing a text file where on each row there are two terms separated by a semicolon.

### The Configuration frame
Allows the user to configure the way the study set will be presented. This includes filtering the cards is the study set to show either all the cards or just cards with a particular tag. It also includes the order in which the cards will be displayed, for example, in a random order. And it allows the user to define which side of the card will be shown first.
